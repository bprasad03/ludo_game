## üìù Description

This Ludo game allows 2-4 players to enjoy the traditional Ludo experience on a digital platform. The game includes:  

- Rolling dice to determine token movement  
- Moving tokens around the board  
- Handling basic Ludo rules (e.g., opening a token on rolling 6)  
- Simple and intuitive **Tkinter-based GUI**  
- Game title and logo display  

This project is **recreated** using resources from **YouTube tutorials** and **open-source GitHub repositories** for learning purposes.

## üéØ Objectives

- Learn **Python programming** with GUI applications  
- Understand **event handling** in Tkinter  
- Implement basic **board game rules** programmatically  
- Create a **fun, interactive game** with simple UI

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

Through this project, I learned how to:

- Implement and work with **Python libraries**, especially **Tkinter** for GUI development.  
- Handle **game rules and logic** programmatically, such as moving tokens, opening tokens on rolling a 6, and enforcing turn-based play.  
- Structure a small project with **interactive elements** and a basic user interface.  

This project helped me strengthen my understanding of **Python programming, event handling, and GUI design**, while recreating a fun, classic board game.
